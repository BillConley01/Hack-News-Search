# Hacker-News-Search
A web page that allows users to perform a keyword search of Hacker News articles
<p>This is the code for a basic Web application made with React to provides for a key word search of haacker News Articles. It originated from an assignment in Week #15 of MIT's MERN Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to fetch data from an external source and build a site and user experience around the data organizing and displaying the fetched data in a way that is appropriate to the story being told with the data. .</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ol>
<li>React useState is used to hold the URL address for the article feeds.</li>
<li>React useEffect is used to implement the fetch functions.</li>
<li>React useReducer is used to track the status of the data stream.</li>
<li>Axios is used to make the fetch request.</li>
<li>ReactBoot is used for styling components.</li>
<li>An Adobe stock photo was used for the background of the page.</li>
